# drl_p2_continuous-control

The contents of this repository represent project 2 of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning course. In this project, we are solving the reacher environment which consists of controlling the movements of a double-jointed arm. By performing actions on this double-jointed arm, we can learn an optimal control policy.

In order to perform this training, we use the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. We solve this algorithm in a multi-agent case, where to goal is, using 20 agents, maintain a reward of +30 for at least 100 consecutive episodes.

The code can be run by opening the notebook Continuous_Control.ipynb and running all cells.
